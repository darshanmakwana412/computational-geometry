# Line Arrangement

A line arrangement $A(L)$ of a set of lines $L$ is a subdivision of the plane induced by the lines in $L$

$A(L)$ is called simple if no 3 points intersect at a point

## Complexity of $A(L)$

The combinatorial complexity of $A(L)$ is the number of edges, vertices and faces it contains
