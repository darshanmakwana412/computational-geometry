# Some Problems

Given a set P of n points determine wether there are 3 points that lie on a line

Given a set P of n points determine the vertices $p, q, r \in \R$ such that the triangle corresponding to them has the least area

# What is Duality?

A trasformation from the primal space to the dual space

### Duality between Points and Lines

$$
p = (p_{x}, p_{y}) \to p^{*} : y = p_{x}x - p_{y}
$$

$$
l : y = mx + b \to l^{*} : (m, -b)

$$

### Properties of Duality

Self Inverse : $(p^{*})^{*} = p$ and $(l^{*})^{*} = l$

Vertical distances are preserved
